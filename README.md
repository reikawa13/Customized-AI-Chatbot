# Full-Stack AI Chatbot with OpenAI API
## Overview
Have you ever wondered how you could **receive more reliable, comprehensive information conversationally** when you need information about specific topics? For example, when you need to know about the application process of foreign universities, you might need to conduct detailed, time-consuming research on your own from zero. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a chatbot where you could ask questions and receive entry points for your more specific research? 

This project provides a solution to this problem by creating an **AI chatbot with OpenAI GPT and the MERN stack website**. In addition to the chatbot feature, this application stores user information and chat history in the database (MongoDB) and conducts in-depth user authentication with JWT tokens. 

Developers can utilize this project to provide a further customized chatbot by fine-tuning the OpenAI GPT. In the future, I plan to fine-tune this GPT model in the application process and the student lives at foreign universities. 

## The technologies used:
* NodeJS: backend
* MongoDB: database for user information and chat history 
* Vite and ReactJS: frontend 
* JWT and HTTP-only cookies: user authentication
* Material-UI: UI features
