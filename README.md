# Full-Stack AI Chatbot with OpenAI API
## Overview
Have you ever wondered how you could *receive more reliable, comprehensive information conversationally* when you need information about specific topics? For example, when you need to know about the application process of foreign universities, you might need to conduct detailed, time-consuming research on your own from zero. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a chatbot where you could ask questions and receive entry points for your more specific research? 

This project provides a solution to this problem by creating an *AI chatbot with OpenAI GPT and the MERN stack website*. Developers can utilize this project to provide a further customized chatbot by fine-tuning the OpenAI GPT. In the future, I plan to fine-tune this GPT model in the application process and the student lives at foreign universities.
